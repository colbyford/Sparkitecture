# About Spark MLlib

MLlib is Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library.

### Included Functionality:

#### ML algorithms include:

* Classification: logistic regression, naive Bayes,...
* Regression: generalized linear regression, survival regression,...
* Decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees
* Recommendation: alternating least squares \(ALS\)
* Clustering: K-means, Gaussian mixtures \(GMMs\),...
* Topic modeling: latent Dirichlet allocation \(LDA\)
* Frequent itemsets, association rules, and sequential pattern mining

#### ML workflow utilities include:

* Feature transformations: standardization, normalization, hashing,...
* ML Pipeline construction
* Model evaluation and hyper-parameter tuning
* ML persistence: saving and loading models and Pipelines

#### Other utilities include:

* Distributed linear algebra: SVD, PCA,...
* Statistics: summary statistics, hypothesis testing,...
