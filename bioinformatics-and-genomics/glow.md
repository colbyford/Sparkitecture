## About Glow

Glow is an open-source and independent Spark library that brings even more flexibility and functionality to Azure Databricks. This toolkit is natively built on Apache Spark, enabling the scale of the cloud for genomics workflows.

Glow allows for genomic data to work with Spark SQL. So, you can interact with common genetic data types as easily as you can play with a .csv file.  _Learn more about Project Glow at_ [_projectglow.io_](http://projectglow.io/)_._
